# Vaccum Intelligent Agent

**Goal** 

Implement an agent by using searching algorithm. 
This robot has to clean several room in a castle. Dirt and jewels are randomly generated and our robot has to think about the shortest way to collect jewel and suck dirt.

**Solution**

 Two types of algorithm has been used :
 - Uninformed : Bread First Search (https://github.com/louiselize/Vacuum_Intelligent_Agent/blob/main/Uninformed.cs
 - Informed : Greedy Search with Manhattan distance heursitic
 
 **Collaborators**
 
 - Yoann Ayoub : evaluate which algorithms are the best
 - Louise Liz√© : implement all the code
